In reality, the computer wanted the other contestants to beat it due to the computer's own uncertainty.
Watson is unable to pull together abstract ideas from a diverse range of subjects and draw connections. It can’t take math knowledge and put it to music, it is limited within the task it is asked to write. This limits it from progressing subjects and discovering new ideas requiring cognitive.
