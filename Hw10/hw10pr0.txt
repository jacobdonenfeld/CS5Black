I scored 4/6 on the quiz. I looked at how much sense the poems make and how the ideas connect. I think automatic authoring is beneficial for reporting news just as it happens. Automatic authoring can take much less time than a human, and allow an article to be published right after something happens. It does seem like automatic authoring is almost just as good as humans, as long as they have the same amount of data. This could lead to a loss of jobs but overall allow humans to focus on other things.
