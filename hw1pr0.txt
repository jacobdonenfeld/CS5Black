I agree with the statement that we " don't have to settle for models at all." With the abundance of data available now, algorithms can draw connections and are able to predict outcomes better than any science. If there is enough data so 99 times out of 100, a computer would predict something correct, the need for a further understanding is removed. While there could be the argument made that compiling data on very discreet scientific topics can be too complicated to do, we can still assume that with enough data, models are made obsolete. Mathematics and computer science is able to compile data, letting us extract meaning afterwards.
