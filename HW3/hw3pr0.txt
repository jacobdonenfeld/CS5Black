I believe we are in a simulation. Based on the article, it seems logical that we would eventually devise the reality of running our own simulations and subjecting others into them on a widespead basis. The idea of mathematical concepts are simply discovering bits of the code of the simulation seems very plausable. I don't believe thinking whether we are or are not in a simulation changes my view on the world. No matter what reality I believe I exist in, the signals my brain receives and interprets are not changed by knowing if I am in a simulation. I still feel the same feelings and see the same things.
